# Automatic Fake News Detection using NLP (Work in progress)

In this project we used SVM and Random Forest to to classify political statements from the LIAR dataset (n = 12792) as fake news or not.
Three different models (bag-of-words with tf-idf, word2vec, doc2vec) were used to create embeddings from text. For each of them, several configurations and parameters were tried. 
Python libraries used: pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, gensim.
